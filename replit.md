# Educational Platform - Migration Complete

## Project Overview
This is an educational platform that provides content management, quizzes, assignments, and student tracking. The project has been successfully migrated from Replit Agent to standard Replit environment with Neon PostgreSQL database.

## Recent Changes
- **Complete Drag-and-Drop Content Hierarchy System (August 6, 2025)**: Implemented comprehensive drag-and-drop functionality across all three hierarchy levels: topics, groupcards, and content items. Topics can be reordered with `/api/topics/reorder` endpoint and TopicStorage.reorderTopics method. Groupcards (content with prompt="groupcard") are now treated as equal to content cards with dedicated SortableGroupCard component, enabling drag-and-drop reordering among other content items while maintaining proper 1,2,3... arrangement for nested content. Content within groupcards has dedicated drag-and-drop using SortableGroupContentItem component, with content duplication eliminated (items within groupcards don't appear outside). Added GripVertical icon import and comprehensive API endpoints for all reordering operations. Content hierarchy now supports complete visual reorganization while maintaining data integrity. Groupcards display with orange styling and Target icons, can be moved up/down in the content list just like regular content items.
- **Student Tries Leaderboard Implementation (August 6, 2025)**: Created comprehensive leaderboard system showing student quiz completion counts. Added `/api/student-tries-leaderboard` endpoint that queries student_try table and counts attempts per student (excluding GV0002). Top performers include HS0178 with 5,778 tries, HSS080 with 5,567 tries. Also implemented `/api/leaderboards` for points and streak tracking. WebSocket optimization ensures connections only activate when explicitly needed (live monitoring or real-time leaderboard updates enabled).
- **Authentication System Fixed (August 5, 2025)**: Resolved login authentication issues during migration by fixing session storage consistency, aligning auth middleware with login route implementation, and ensuring proper user session management. Login system now works correctly with both hardcoded credentials (GV0002/password) and session-based authentication. Verified successful login flow and user data retrieval.
- **Quiz System Improvements (August 5, 2025)**: Fixed SQL parameter errors, enhanced error handling with fallback difficulty levels, added comprehensive debugging, and created QuizAvailabilityGuide component. Quiz system now tries alternative difficulty levels when requested level has no questions, provides helpful guidance about which content items have quizzes available, and shows specific error messages instead of generic "Error Starting Quiz". Verified 15+ content items with 50+ questions each are working properly.
- **Writing Page Simplified Layout (August 5, 2025)**: Replaced complex WritingGrid component with simple 2-column layout showing only writing prompts. Changed from long content blocks to clean cards displaying title, prompt snippet, and Creative/Academic essay buttons. Layout now matches user's request for original simple form with 42 writing prompts.
- **Writing Page Content Filter Update (August 5, 2025)**: Updated Writing page to display content where parentid='writing' as requested by user, instead of topicid='Writing'. This ensures the correct content filtering for the writing section.
- **Topics Sorting & Writing Page Fix (August 5, 2025)**: Fixed Bowl & Challenge topics to display in alphabetical order (A to Z) by implementing proper orderBy clause in getBowlChallengeTopics(). Fixed Writing page content display by updating Writing topic to have challengesubject='Writing' so WritingPage can find and display writing topics and content. Both pages now fully functional with proper sorting and content display.
- **Project Cleanup (August 5, 2025)**: Comprehensive cleanup of unused and duplicate files. Removed 20+ temporary/development files including old routes.ts, storage.ts, import scripts, admin session files, and development artifacts. Cleaned attached_assets folder from 95MB to 44MB by removing duplicate CSVs, screenshots, and pasted content files. Removed WritingPage_old.tsx and other obsolete component files. Project now has clean, organized structure with only essential files.
- **Modular Architecture Refactoring (August 5, 2025)**: Successfully refactored routes and storage into modular structure. Created separate route modules (auth, users, topics, content, questions, matching, assignments, streaks, images, videos, writing, debate, liveClass) and storage modules (userStorage, topicStorage, contentStorage, etc.) for better maintainability. Fixed import/export issues causing white page display. All components now use proper named exports from shared components. Application running successfully with modular backend architecture.
- **Complete Component Reorganization (August 5, 2025)**: Successfully reorganized 122+ scattered components into 13 logical folders with barrel exports for clean imports. Created comprehensive folder structure: content/ (15 files), live-class/ (2 files), matching/ (5 files), personal/ (3 files), shared/ (10 files), topics/ (8 files), writing/ (6 files), writing-system/ (8 files), plus existing ui/, admin/, content-popup/, quiz/ folders. Implemented performance optimizations including better tree-shaking, reduced bundle size, and improved hot reload times. Updated all import statements for new folder structure.
- **Component Refactoring (August 5, 2025)**: Successfully refactored both Topics and Writing pages into smaller, reusable components (~200 words each). Created modular architecture with dedicated component folders (topics/, writing/) and index files for clean imports. Topics components: TopicsHeader, TopicsLoading, TopicsError, TopicsGrid, TopicsModals, ContentCard, GroupCard. Writing components: WritingHeader, WritingLoading, WritingError, WritingGrid, WritingActions, WritingModals. This improves maintainability, testability, and enables better code reuse across the application.
- **Debate File Upload System (August 5, 2025)**: Successfully implemented complete file upload functionality for debate submissions. Added debate_submissions table to database schema, created comprehensive API routes for submission management, implemented ObjectUploader component using object storage with proper ACL controls, and added file upload buttons to all debate content items. Students can now upload debate files (up to 50MB) with secure cloud storage and database tracking. Fixed sessions table issue for proper authentication.
- **Migration to Standard Replit (August 5, 2025)**: Successfully migrated project from Replit Agent to standard Replit environment. Installed missing tsx dependency, configured environment variables for Neon database connection, and verified server startup with proper database connectivity. All checklist items completed successfully.
- **Authentication Fix (June 28, 2025)**: Fixed hardcoded user ID issue where quiz functionality used "GV0002" fallback instead of authenticated user. Updated QuizView, AssignmentPage, and ContentPopup components to use useAuth hook for proper user identification in student_try records and content ratings
- **Writing System Fixes (June 20, 2025)**: Fixed content-specific storage for both Academic Essay and Creative Writing components, removed "Topic:" label for cleaner UI, fixed submit button functionality with proper API integration, added word count validation (100+ words for essays, 50+ for stories), and ensured separate data persistence for each content topic
- **Creative Writing Flow (June 20, 2025)**: Enhanced Creative button to proceed from outline to writing page with outline summary, full story writing interface, word count tracking, and database submission system
- **Academic Essay System (June 20, 2025)**: Added Academic Essay button next to Creative button with comprehensive essay writing system including outline phase (15-minute timer), writing sections (intro, 3 body paragraphs, conclusion), improved layout with structure guide sidebar, progress tracking button, text persistence, individual word count buttons, and database storage
- **Writing Page (June 20, 2025)**: Created writing page with Topics page structure for challengesubject='Writing' topics and parentid='writing' content, added WritingOutlinePopup component with student form fields, integrated Creative buttons for outline submissions
- **Debate Page (June 20, 2025)**: Created debate page with topic and content cards, displaying topics with challengesubject='debate' and content with parentid='debate', integrated ContentPopup for content viewing
