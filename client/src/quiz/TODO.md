### Key Design Principles:
- Maintain backward compatibility at all costs
- Preserve existing external APIs
- Centralize state management without breaking functionality
- Enable future extensibility for live quizzes and advanced features
- Real-time performance with WebSocket optimization

### Testing Strategy:
- Test each unified hook independently
- Verify component updates don't break existing functionality
- Confirm database operations remain identical
- Performance testing for state management improvements
- Live quiz session testing with multiple participants

### Next Steps for Production:
1. **WebSocket Server Implementation**: Backend WebSocket server for live sessions
2. **Database Schema**: Tables for live quiz sessions, participants, and results
3. **Performance Optimization**: Connection pooling, message queuing
4. **Security**: Session authentication, participant validation
5. **Scalability**: Load balancing for multiple concurrent sessions
