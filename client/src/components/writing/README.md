# Writing Components Refactoring

This directory contains the refactored WritingPage components, each designed to be around 200 words or less and highly reusable.

## Components Overview

### Core Layout Components
- **WritingHeader** (~60 words) - Header with title, panels, and navigation
- **WritingLoading** (~30 words) - Loading state with spinner for writing topics
- **WritingError** (~25 words) - Error state display for failed writing topic loads
- **WritingGrid** (~200 words) - Main grid layout for writing topics with custom actions
- **WritingModals** (~150 words) - All modal/popup components container for writing

### Action Components
- **WritingActions** (~180 words) - Custom action buttons for creative and academic writing with progress indicators

## Usage

```tsx
import {
  WritingHeader,
  WritingLoading,
  WritingError,
  WritingGrid,
  WritingActions,
  WritingModals
} from '@/components/writing';
```

## Benefits

1. **Reusability** - Each component can be used independently in other writing-related pages
2. **Maintainability** - Small, focused components are easier to debug and update
3. **Testability** - Individual components can be unit tested in isolation
4. **Performance** - Smaller components enable better tree-shaking and code splitting
5. **Readability** - Clear separation of concerns and reduced complexity

## Integration

The main WritingPage now uses these components:
- Conditional rendering with WritingLoading/WritingError
- WritingHeader for navigation and title display with panels
- WritingGrid for the main content layout with WritingActions
- WritingModals for all popup interactions (outline, essay, creative writing, content)

Each component maintains the same functionality as the original monolithic component while being more modular and reusable. The WritingActions component handles complex localStorage-based progress tracking for both creative and academic writing modes.
