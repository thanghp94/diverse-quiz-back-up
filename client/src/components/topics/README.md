# Topics Components Refactoring

This directory contains the refactored Topics page components, each designed to be around 200 words or less and highly reusable.

## Components Overview

### Core Layout Components
- **TopicsHeader** (~60 words) - Header with title, panels, and navigation
- **TopicsLoading** (~30 words) - Loading state with spinner
- **TopicsError** (~25 words) - Error state display
- **TopicsGrid** (~80 words) - Main grid layout for topic items
- **TopicsModals** (~40 words) - All modal/popup components container

### Content Components  
- **ContentCard** (~120 words) - Individual content item display with actions
- **GroupCard** (~150 words) - Topic group with expandable content and subtopics

## Usage

```tsx
import {
  TopicsHeader,
  TopicsLoading, 
  TopicsError,
  TopicsGrid,
  TopicsModals,
  ContentCard,
  GroupCard
} from '@/components/topics';
```

## Benefits

1. **Reusability** - Each component can be used independently in other pages
2. **Maintainability** - Small, focused components are easier to debug and update
3. **Testability** - Individual components can be unit tested in isolation
4. **Performance** - Smaller components enable better tree-shaking and code splitting
5. **Readability** - Clear separation of concerns and reduced complexity

## Integration

The main Topics page now uses these components:
- Conditional rendering with TopicsLoading/TopicsError
- TopicsHeader for navigation and title display
- TopicsGrid for the main content layout
- TopicsModals for all popup interactions
- ContentCard and GroupCard for detailed item displays

Each component maintains the same functionality as the original monolithic component while being more modular and reusable.
